Riak CS provides operational statistics that can be useful for
monitoring through the Folsom statistics library, and initial probes for
analysis of the running system with
[DTrace](http://dtrace.org/blogs/about/).

## Operational Statistics

Much like Riak, Riak CS exposes statistics on critical operations that
are commonly used for monitoring, alerting, and trend analysis. These
statistics can be accessed through HTTP requests to the following
resource:

```http
/riak-cs/stats
```

That will return a JSON object containing a series of latency histograms
and counters for a variety of operations, e.g. `object_get` and
`block_put`. Alongside each operation there will be a list showing the
count and rate for the operation, as well as a latency histogram showing
mean, median, and 95th and 99th percentiles:

```json
<operation_name>: [MeterCount, MeterRate, LatencyMean, LatencyMedian, Latency95, Latency99]
```

You will see a list of that form for each of the following operations:

Operation | Description
:---------|:-----------
`block_get` | Total BLOCK GET operations performed
`block_put` | Total BLOCK GET operations performed
`block_delete` | Total BLOCK DELETE operations performed
`service_get_buckets` | Total GET BUCKETS operations performed
`bucket_list_keys` | Total BUCKET LIST KEYS operations performed
`bucket_create` | Total BUCKET CREATE operations performed
`bucket_delete` | Total BUCKET DELETE operations performed
`bucket_get_acl` | Total BUCKET GET ACL operations performed
`bucket_put_acl` | Total BUCKET PUT ACL operations performed
`object_get` | Total GET operations performed
`object_put` | Total PUT operations performed
`object_head` | Total OBJECT HEAD operations performed
`object_delete` | Total OBJECT DELETE operations performed
`object_get_acl` | Total OBJECT GET ACL operations performed
`object_put_acl` | Total OBJECT PUT ACL operations performed

## DTrace Probes

Riak CS is built with some probes for use with
[[DTrace|http://dtrace.org/blogs/about/]] to inspect certain operations
in the live system, which can be helpful in diagnosing issues.

### Usage Examples

The following are examples of using DTrace for inspecting various
components of a running Riak CS installation.

#### Trace User Object Requests

```bash
dtrace -qn 'erlang*:::user_trace* /arg2 == 703/ {printf("pid %s: mod %s op %s: user %s bucket/file %s\n", copyinstr(arg0), copyinstr(arg6), copyinstr(arg7), copyinstr(arg8), copyinstr(arg9));}'
```

#### Trace Webmachine Resource Execution

```bash
dtrace -qn 'erlang*:::user_trace* /arg2 == 705/ {printf("pid %s: %s:%s\n", copyinstr(arg0), copyinstr(arg6), copyinstr(arg7));}'
```

<div class="title">Note on DTrace Support</div>
Work on packaging of Riak CS for SmartOS and other operating systems
with DTrace support is ongoing with the goal of providing enhanced
ability to diagnose low-level issues in instances of Riak CS running on
such operating systems.
