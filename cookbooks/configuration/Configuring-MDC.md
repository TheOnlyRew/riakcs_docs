<div class="note">
<div class="title">Riak CS Enterprise requires a separate download</div>
Please note that Riak CS Enterprise requires a download separate from
the open-source Riak CS, which will not work in conjunction with Riak
Enterprise.
</div>

Configuratin Multi-Datacenter Replication in Riak CS requires the
addition of a new group of settings to the `app.config` configuration
file for all Riak CS and Riak Enterprise nodes that are part of the Riak
CS cluster.

## Riak Enterprise Configuration

As of Riak release 1.4.0, there are two different MDC replication modes
that Riak CS can use to request data from remote clusters. Please see
the [[comparison|Multi Data Center Replication: Comparison]] doc for
more information.

### Replication Version 3 Configuration

For each Riak node in the cluster, update the `riak_repl` section of
`app.config` by appending the `{proxy_get, enabled}` setting as shown in
the following example.

```erlang
{riak_repl, [
             %% Other configs
             {fullsync_on_connect, true},
             {fullsync_interval, 360},
             {data_root, "/var/lib/riak/data/riak_repl"},
             {proxy_get, enabled}
             %% Other configs
            ]}
```

Version 3 replication requires additional configuration in the **source
cluster** via the command line.

```bash
riak-repl proxy_get enable <sink_cluster_name>
```

The `sink_cluster_name` should be replaced with the name of your
configured **sink cluster**.

## Riak CS Configuration

For each Riak CS node in the cluster, update the `riak_cs` section of
the `app.config` by appending the `{proxy_get, enabled}` setting as
shown in the following example.

```erlang
{riak_cs, [
           %% Other configs
           {cs_ip, "127.0.0.1"},
           {cs_port, 8080 },
           {proxy_get, enabled},
           %% Other configs
          ]}
```

<div class ="note">
<div class="title">Note on restarting Riak nodes</div>
Be sure that you restart cluster nodes in a rolling fashion after making
configuration changes. In particular, after restarting a node, be sure
that you wait for Riak's key/value store to become available before
restarting the next node. To check the status of `riak_kv` on a node
after restarting, execute the following command:

```bash
riak-admin wait-for-service riak_kv <nodename>
```

Replace the `node` variable above with the nodename specified in the
`vm.args` configuration file.
</div>

## Stanchion Configuration

Though there is no specific configuration for [[Stanchion]], note that
Stanchion should be a single, globally unique process to which every
Riak CS node sends requests, even if there are multiple replicated
sites.  Unlike Riak and Riak CS, Stanchion should run on _only one node
in a given cluster_, perhaps on its own, dedicated hardware if you wish.
Stanchion runs on only one node because it manages strongly consistent
updates to [[globally unique
entities|Stanchion#Globally-Unique-Entities]] like users and buckets.
