This document shows you how to configure Riak CS to work with the
[OpenStack Keystone](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/)
authentication service.

Riak CS can be configured to use either the OpenStack Object Storage API
or the S3 API in conjunction with Keystone for authentication.

## Terminology

In a system that uses Keystone for authentication, there are three main
entity types to be aware of: `tenants`, `users`, and `roles`.

* `tenant` --- A tenant is a collection entity that can contain a number
  of users
* `user` --- A user represents an individual that uses the OpenStack
  system
* `role` --- A role is used to define a link between a user and a tenant
  and to indicate permissions of the user within that tenant

The OpenStack `tenant_id` maps to a `key_id` to identify a user account
in Riak CS. In OpenStack, only users who are assigned an `operator` role
for a tenant may perform operations. Other users that belong to a tenant
may be granted access using ACLs.

Currently, Riak CS does not support OpenStack ACLs and only permits
access to  tenant operators. ACLs will be supported at a later date.

By default, Riak CS recognizes `admin` and `swiftoperator` as valid
operator roles, but that list can be configured.

Riak CS does not currently support the use of multiple authentication
servers via *reseller prefixes*, but if this turns out to be important
based on user feedback, support may be added in the future.

## Configuration

#### API

Set the API using the `rewrite_module` configuration option. To use the
S3 API, insert the following:

```erlang
{rewrite_module, riak_cs_s3_rewrite}
```

To use the OpenStack object storage API:

```erlang
{rewrite_module, riak_cs_oos_rewrite}
```

#### Authentication Module

Set the authentication module to specify the Keystone authentication
module:

```erlang
{auth_module, riak_cs_keystone_auth}
```

#### Operator Roles

You may optionally override the default list of valid operator roles. The
default roles are `admin` and `swiftoperator`, but others may be used:

```erlang
{os_operator_roles,  [<<"admin">>, <<"swiftoperator">>, <<"cinnamon">>]}
```

**Note**: Each role should be formatted as shown above, with two angle
brackets preceding and following each role value.

#### Root Host

Make sure that the value of the `cs_root_host` key in the Riak CS
configuration matches the root host used for the object store in the
Keystone configuration.

For example, given the following config snippet from a Keystone
configuration file, the value for `cs_root_host` should be set to
`object.store.host`:

```config
catalog.RegionOne.object_store.publicURL = http://object.store.host/v1/AUTH_$(tenant_id)s
catalog.RegionOne.object_store.adminURL = http://object.store.host/
catalog.RegionOne.object_store.internalURL = http://object.store.host/v1/AUTH_$(tenant_id)s
```

The entry in the Riak CS config would be as follows:

```erlang
{cs_root_host, "object.store.host"}
```

#### Admin Token

Riak CS needs to know the administration token so that it can
successfully validate user tokens with Keystone. If no value for
`os_admin_token` is specified, the default value is `ADMIN`. The value
can be set by adding the following to the Riak CS configuration file:

```erlang
{os_admin_token, "SNARFSNARFSNARF"}
```

#### Auth URL

Riak CS also needs to know the authentication URL to use to communicate
with Keystone. The default value is `"http://localhost:5000/v2.0"`. To
override this value add the following to the Riak CS configuration file:

```erlang
{os_auth_url, "http://host.with.the.most.com/5000/v2.0"}
```

#### Keystone Resources

Riak CS needs to be be aware of a few resources to be able to perform
authentication with Keystone. These resources are unlikely to need to be
changed from their defaults, but that capability is provided in case the
need arises.

* Token Resources

The default is `"tokens/"`. To override this, add the following to the
Riak CS configuration file:

```erlang
{os_tokens_resource, "mytokens/"}
```

* S3 Token Resources

This resource is only used when the S3 API is used in conjunction with
Keystone authentication. The default is `"s3tokens/"`. To override this,
add the following to the Riak CS configuration file:

```erlang
{os_s3_tokens_resource, "mys3tokens/"}
```

* User Resources

The default is `"users/"`. To override this, add the following to the
Riak CS configuration file:

```erlang
{os_users_resource, "users/"}
```

## Testing

### Keystone Setup

Follow the procedures documented in [[Keystone Setup]] to set up and run
Keystone.

1. Create a tenant called `test`:

    ```bash
    keystone tenant-create --name test
    ```

1. Using the tenant id of the tenant created in the previous step and
   create a user called `test` that is a member of tenant `test`:

    ```bash
    keystone user-create --name test \
      --pass test --email test@test.com \
      --tenant-id <tenant-id> --enabled true
    ```

1. Create a role called `swiftoperator`:

    ```bash
    keystone role-create --name swiftoperator
    ```

1. Add the `swiftoperator` role for user `test`:

    ```bash
    keystone user-role-add --user-id <user-id>  \
    --role-id <role-id> --tenant-id <tenant-id>
    ```

1. Create ec2 credentials for the user `test`:

    ```bash
    keystone ec2-credentials-create --user_id <user-id> \
    --tenant_id <tenant-id>
    ```

### Testing Openstack API and Keystone authentication

1. Start Riak, Riak CS, and Stanchion. Make sure that the values for the
   `rewrite_module` and `auth_module` options in the Riak CS
   `app.config` file are as follows:

    ```erlang
    {rewrite_module, riak_cs_oos_rewrite},
    {auth_module, riak_cs_keystone_auth},
    ```

1. Get an auth token for the `test` user to use in requests to Riak CS:

    ```curl
    curl -s -d '{"auth": {"tenantName": "test", "passwordCredentials": {"username": "test", "password": "test"}}}' \
      -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
      http://localhost:5000/v2.0/tokens | python -mjson.tool
    ```

    The value of the `id` field of the `token` object in the response is
    used as the value for the `X-Auth-Token` header in all subsequent
    requests to Riak CS. The `publicURL` for the `object-store` service
    listed in the `serviceCatalog` of the response is the base URL used
    for all API requests to Riak CS.

    Now export the token and public URL, like this:

    ```bash
    export ID=20f1a9e46ebd42a3bdd03e009722eeb8
    export URL=http://localhost:8080/v1/AUTH_8d84a17ac99d49fcb6f35c767dd562db
    ```

1. Create a bucket (S3 bucket == OpenStack container)

    ```curl
    curl -X PUT \
      -H 'X-Auth-Token: $ID' \
      $URL/bucket1
    ```

1. List the buckets

    ```curl
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: $ID' \
      $URL
    ```

1. Put an object into the bucket

    ```curl 
    curl -X PUT \
      -H 'X-Auth-Token: $ID' \
      --data 'abcdefghi123456789' \
      $URL/bucket1/object1
    ```

1. List the objects in the bucket

    ```curl
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: $ID' \
      $URL/bucket1
    ```

1. Fetch the object from the bucket

    ```curl
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: $ID' \
      $URL/bucket1/object1
    ```

1. Delete the object

    ```curl
    curl -X DELETE \
      -H 'X-Auth-Token: $ID' \
      $URL/bucket1/object1
    ```
1. Delete the bucket

    ```curl
    curl -X DELETE \
      -H 'X-Auth-Token: $ID' \
      $URL/bucket1
    ```

### Testing S3 API and Keystone Authentication

1. If Riak and Stanchion are not already running, start them now.

1. Edit the Riak CS `app.config` file and restart Riak CS. The values
for `rewrite_module` and `auth_module` should be be as follows:

    ```erlang
    {rewrite_module, riak_cs_s3_rewrite},
    {auth_module, riak_cs_keystone_auth},
    ```

1. Use the values of `access` and `secret` from the EC2 credentials
   created for the `test` user as the `key_id` and `key_secret` for
   signing requests. For example, if you are using `s3cmd`, use these
   credentials for the `access_key` and `secret_key` fields of the
   `.s3cfg` file. The subsequent examples are done using `s3cmd` since
   it is a fairly common tool.

1. Create a sample file to upload

    ```bash
    echo "ilovechickenilovelivermeowmixmeowmixwilldeliver" > upload.txt
    ```

1. Create a bucket (i.e. container)

    ```bash
    s3cmd mb s3://bucket2
    ```

1. List the buckets

    ```bash
    s3cmd ls
    ```

1. Put an object into the bucket

    ```bash
    s3cmd put upload.txt s3://bucket2
    ```

1. Fetch the object from the bucket

    ```bash
    ss3cmd get s3://bucket2/upload.txt download.txt
    ```

1. Delete the object

    ```bash
    s3cmd del s3://bucket2/upload.txt
    ```

1. Delete the bucket

    ```bash
    s3cmd rb s3://bucket2
    ```
