Once a user has been created, you should designate a user as an admin by
editing and replacing the `admin_key` and `admin_secret` in `app.config`
with the user's credentials. Once this is done, do not forget to update
the same credentials in the Stanchion `app.config` as well.

This is a powerful role and gives the designee administrative
capabilities within the system. As such, caution should be used to
protect the access credentials of the admin user.
